# Creation of Personal Website

My website is available [here](matteolarrode.github.io). THIS IS AN ONGOING PROJECT, NOT A FINAL VERSION.


## Rationale
<p>
Working on my resume, I realized that I could not develop as much as I wanted on the many experiences that made the data analyst that I am. 
As part of the cs50x online course that I took last year, I learnt the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Building a website from scratch was the best opportunity to apply this new knowledge on a useful asset for my job applications. 
</p>

<p>
It is a first website and I do not aspire to become a web developer so it has a lot of faults, both aesthetically and in the user experience. However, it was a really interesting project to undertake, and it taught me many valueable lessons of problem-solving, self-motivation and persistence. The website allows me to gather and reflect on the past experiences that built my diverse skills. It does so in a more exhaustive manner than my resume, that can be accessed on the website.

The website is hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

## React Parallax

<p>

My idea for the website was to base the user experience on scrolling. Similar to the famous Apple product pages, I want to give the website the appearance of 3D depth. After having seen [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgIwjLg4ONk), I decided to use the ReactJS Parallax Component from the react-spring package. A simple parallax effect allows to create the impression of 3D by using one or more objects or backgrounds, each object or background having a different speed motion.

[React-spring parallax](https://react-spring.dev/components/parallax) includes the <code>Parallax</code> element that creates a scrollable container, and <code>ParallaxLayer</code>s that contain the content and move according to their offsets and speeds. The app is coded in [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html), a syntax extension to JavaScript. A CSS stylesheet is also used.
